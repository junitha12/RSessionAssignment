1. Say True or False for the below statements:
• Prescriptive Analytics used to predict the future outcomes?  
Answer:FALSE
• Base R packages installed automatically?  
Answer:TRUE
2. What is Recycling of elements in a vector?
Answer:When applying an operation to two vectors that requires them to be the same length, R automatically recycles, 
or repeats, elements of the shorter one, until it is long enough to match the longer Vector.
3. Give an example of recycling of elements.
Answer:Suppose we define two Vectors A and B as below
A=c(1,2,4) 
B=c(6,0,9,10,13) where A is shorter with only 3 elements. Now if we sum these two, we will get a warning message as follows.
> A + B
[1]  7  2 13 11 15
Warning message:
In A + B : longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length
Here R , Sum those Vectors by Recycling or repeating the elements in shorter one, until it is long enough to match the longer one 
as below:
> c(1,2,4,1,2) + c(6,0,9,10,13)
[1]  7  2 13 11 15
